### REGISTER NUMBER : 212222230180
### Aim: Scenario-Based Report Development Utilizing Diverse Prompting Techniques
### Algorithm:  
The goal of this experiment is to design and develop an AI-powered chatbot that can handle customer inquiries, provide support, and improve customer experience in a retail environment. Create prompts using various AI prompting techniques to guide your experiment, data collection, analysis, and report creation

### Select Prompting Techniques: 
Choose a variety of prompting methods including:

1. Zero-shot prompting

2. Few-shot prompting

3. Chain-of-thought prompting

4. Role-based prompting

5. Instructional prompting

### Design Prompts: 
Construct prompts for each technique to cover a range of customer service scenarios.

### Simulate Interactions: 
Execute prompts via an AI language model and simulate customer interactions.

### Collect Data: 
Record responses, analyze chatbot performance, and gather user sentiment data.

### Analyze Results: 
Compare the effectiveness of each technique based on accuracy, engagement, and customer satisfaction.

### Document Findings: 
Create a scenario-based report summarizing methodology, experiments, observations, and results.

## Prompting Techniques and Examples
### 1. Zero-shot Prompting
Prompt Example:
“You are a helpful customer service assistant. A user has asked, ‘What’s your return policy?’ Provide a clear and concise answer.”

### 2. Few-shot Prompting
Prompt Example:
Q: “Do you offer free shipping?”
A: “Yes, we offer free shipping for orders over $50.”
Q: “How can I cancel my order?”
A: “You can cancel your order from the account dashboard within 30 minutes of purchase.”
Q: “Can I exchange an item without a receipt?”

### 3. Chain-of-Thought Prompting
Prompt Example:
“A customer wants to return a product after 35 days, but the return policy allows only 30 days. First analyze the policy, then decide on a possible exception, and provide a diplomatic response.”

### 4. Role-based Prompting
Prompt Example:
“You are a friendly and patient customer assistant helping an elderly customer navigate the online store. Guide them step-by-step on how to place an order.”

### 5. Instructional Prompting
Prompt Example:
“List the steps a customer must follow to initiate a return request via the mobile app.”

### Observation
Zero-shot prompting performed well for direct questions but lacked nuance in special cases.

Few-shot prompting handled contextual and policy-related queries more effectively.

Chain-of-thought prompting was particularly effective for logical and policy-enforcement scenarios.

Role-based prompting created a more empathetic and user-focused interaction experience.

Instructional prompting ensured step-by-step clarity in process explanations.


### Result: 
Thus the Prompts were exected succcessfully .
